<h1>Muslim-01 Condolence letter for Doctor's Father-OK</h1>

<h2><b><u>NOTE OF CONDOLENCE</u></b></h2>
<p><b>Dear Sir,</b><br>

It was with a deep sense of grief that we received the news of sad demise of your father. We understand how difficult it is to accept the departure of father - from whom we are born, with whom we spend the longest time of our life starting from the very childhood. Every cell of our body represents them, every breath of ours indebts them. It is really difficult to accept their final departure from us. However, although your father has gone, we are sure he will always be with you in your heart with his love, good wishes and unforgettable memories. We understand that you wanted, needed and hoped to spend more time with your father but all of us know that this is one decision, which is given by the One and Only Allah. We believe and we are sure that you also believe that there must have something good, something peaceful in His decision. Because He is the most Knowledgeable, the most Wise and He never gives any wrong decision and that’s the consolation for us all.<br>

<br>We pray to the Almighty Allah so that He relieves your father from the agony of grave and Hashr, smoothes his passage through Pulsirat and finally bestows him with Jannatul Ferdous. Insha’Allah, Allah Subhanu Ta’la would accept our prayers and would give your father peace in his eternal life.

It was with a deep sense of grief that we received the news of sad demise of your father-in-law,<mark> Md. Azizul Haque. We know he was a freedom fighter. As a freedom fighter, his death is not only a loss for your family but also for the whole country.</mark> We understand there are very rare words, which may comfort you. In fact, words are poor comforters; the only thing we can do is to pray so that he lives in a better place in the after-world. Any final departure is always difficult to accept but we know that, this is one decision which is given by the One and Only Allah. We believe and we are sure that you also believe that there must have something good, something peaceful in His decision. Because He is the most Knowledgeable, the most Wise and He never gives any wrong decision. And that’s the consolation for us all.<br>

<h2><b><u>NOTE OF CONDOLENCE</u></b></h2>
<p><b>Dear Ibrahim,</b><br>

It was with a deep sense of grief that we received the news of sad demise of your wife due to cardiac complication. It is always difficult to accept the death of dear and near ones. We have very rare words to console you. However, although your wife has gone, we are sure she will always be with you in your heart with her love, good wishes and unforgettable memories. We understand that you wanted, needed and hoped to spend more time with your wife but both of us know that, this is one decision which is given by the One and Only Allah. We believe and we are sure that you also believe that there must have something good, something peaceful in His decision. Because He is the most Knowledgeable, the most Wise and He never gives any wrong decision and that’s the consolation for us all.

<br>We pray to the Almighty Allah so that He keeps your wife’s soul in never ending peace and gives you the mental strength to bear this irreparable loss.

<h2><b><u>NOTE OF CONDOLENCE</u></b></h2>
<p><b>Dear Mr. Kamal,</b><br>

With a deep sense of grief, we received the sad news of your father’s demise. We understand how difficult it is to accept the departure of father - from whom we are born, with whom we spend the longest time of our life starting from the very childhood. Every cell of our body represents them, every breath of ours indebts them. It is really difficult to accept their final departure from us. However, although your father has gone, we are sure he will always be with you in your heart with his love, good wishes and unforgettable memories. We understand that you wanted, needed and hoped to spend more time with your father but all of us know that this is one decision, which is given by the One and Only Allah. We believe and we are sure that you also believe that there must have something good, something peaceful in His decision. Because He is the most Knowledgeable, the most Wise and He never gives any wrong decision and that’s the consolation for us all.<br>

<br><mark>Your father has lived almost a fulfilling life of more than 80 years.</mark> Now we pray to the Almighty Allah so that He places your father in Jannatul Ferdous in his eternal life.. We would also ask you to pray the same more and more for your father because prayers of offspring are mostly granted by Allah. Insha’Allah, Allah Subhanu Ta’la would accept our prayers and would give your father peace in his eternal life.

We believe and we are sure that you also believe that there must have something good, something peaceful in His decision. Because He is the most Knowledgeable, the most Wise and He never gives any wrong decision and that’s the consolation for us all.<br>

We pray to the Almighty Allah so that He relieves your brother from the agony of grave and Hashr, smoothes his passage through Pulsirat and finally bestows him with Jannatul Ferdous. In Sha Allah, Allah Subhanu Ta’la would accept our prayers and would give your brother peace in his eternal life.
