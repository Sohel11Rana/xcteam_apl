For the last couple of days, we were eagerly waiting to learn who is going to be the next Director of NICVD. As your normal tenure ended, we know many others were trying to come to this position. But finally, Government has kept trust again on you and we are really enthralled with pleasant feelings to hear the news. We understand there are many other good candidates, may be some of them are better than others but you are the best, no doubt. Through your last few years activities, you have proved that you are not just the best Interventional Cardiologist of the country at this moment, but also the best administrator to run this National Institute. Government has taken the very right decision and we hope that under your leadership, this institute would continue to give the best to the countrymen.<br>
We pray to the Almighty Allah so that He keeps you in good health and bestow you with more success and honour in the future days.
